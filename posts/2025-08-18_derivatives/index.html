ID Derivatives are claims derived from your ID. An &ldquo;age > 18&rdquo; proof is a claim about your age derived from an age attribute of your digitally issued identity.
Portfolio Derivatives are claims derived from your financial assets. A credit score about your financial health can be derived from multiple sources of assets you own &ndash; an IRS-signed tax statement, a bank balance from a TLS-secured webpage, and a merkle proof of your crypto balance. 1"><meta name=author content><link rel=icon type=image/x-icon href=https://liangcc.me/images/favicon-dark.ico><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://liangcc.me/images/apple-touch-icon-dark.png><link rel=stylesheet type=text/css title=light id=light href=https://liangcc.me/stylesheets/light.css><link rel=stylesheet type=text/css title=dark id=dark href=https://liangcc.me/stylesheets/dark.css disabled><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://liangcc.me/custom.min.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://liangcc.me/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://liangcc.me/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.134.2"><meta property="og:url" content="https://liangcc.me/posts/2025-08-18_derivatives/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="CC's blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Data Derivatives"><meta property="og:description" content="I’m proposing to name the class of applications like “age > 18” proofs as “Derivatives.”

<span class=article-list-minutes>5 minute read</span></div></header><div class=article-content><p>I&rsquo;m proposing to name the class of applications like &ldquo;age > 18&rdquo; proofs as &ldquo;Derivatives.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=examples>Examples</h2><p><strong>ID Derivatives</strong> are claims derived from your ID. An &ldquo;age > 18&rdquo; proof is a claim about your age derived from an age attribute of your digitally issued identity.</p><p><strong>Portfolio Derivatives</strong> are claims derived from your financial assets. A credit score about your financial health can be derived from multiple sources of assets you own &ndash; an IRS-signed tax statement, a bank balance from a TLS-secured webpage, and a merkle proof of your crypto balance. <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><p><strong>Email Derivatives</strong> are claims extracted from your email, with tools like <a href=https://zk.email/>zkemail</a>. The applications are massive here, but I&rsquo;ll show just one: You can recover your crypto account by presenting your recovery email derivative.</p><p><strong>Composite Derivatives</strong>: Remix the above to unlock new interesting applications.</p><h2 id=definitions>Definitions</h2><p>An <strong>explicit claim</strong> is a non-trivial fact about a person, recorded in the form of data. For example, these are considered explicit claims: your name or date of birth on your ID, the bank balance from your banking website, or your account balance from the Ethereum blockchain. The degree to which people can treat an explicit claim as fact depends on the quality of the data being generated and registered. A merkle proof of balance on Ethereum is certainly a fact. But a date of birth registered with bribery would be a corrupted claim.</p><p>An <strong>implicit claim</strong> is a fact deduced from the application mechanism. For example, proving knowledge of a secret field in an ID establishes the implicit claim that you are the holder of the ID &ndash; you are the only person on earth capable of crafting the derivative that passes verification. If your secret is stolen, then the implicit claim is considered invalid.</p><p>A <strong>derivable</strong> is a piece of data that contains one or multiple explicit claims.</p><p>A <strong>derivative</strong> is a piece of computationally verifiable data, encapsulating claims derived from derivables.</p><p>Fundamentally, a derivative offers a statement pieced together from one or multiple explicit and implicit claims, sliced and diced from the derivables the claims belong to.</p><h3 id=properties>Properties</h3><p>A derivative is useful because of the following properties:</p><ul><li><strong>Splittable</strong>: a.k.a. Selective Disclosure. A derivable is usually a bundle of multiple explicit claims. A splitting property means you can expose just a subset of them. The main benefit is privacy: you reveal your age without revealing your name together.</li><li><strong>Transformable</strong>: A derivative should not be limited to the face value of the data; it should be able to compute from that data. Your ID only registers your date of birth. It requires computation to derive age from the date of birth. Another cheap step of computation to determine whether age is greater than 18 gives you the benefit of privacy by covering the actual age. Note that the computation step is not arbitrary at runtime; it is a verification process agreed upon beforehand.</li><li><strong>Composable</strong>: A derivative can be derived from multiple derivables like the credit score use case mentioned above.</li><li><strong>Second Derivatives</strong>: A derivative can be a derivable for another new derivative. Just like what you can do in calculus.</li></ul><h2 id=motivation>Motivation</h2><p>Existing terms have some problems. Here are some general problems, and I&rsquo;ll go into specifics in the last section.</p><ul><li>Existing terms are defined around the tooling and the cryptographic techniques, but not the inner workings of applications.</li><li>Good cryptography is hidden cryptography. You no longer see &ldquo;https&rdquo; in the browser URL bar unless you deliberately do so. You don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;let me text my friend with end-to-end encryption,&rdquo; you say &ldquo;let me text my friend.&rdquo; If the cryptography is opening a new set of applications, we should name that application and leave that technicality behind. Users have no bandwidth and no reason to verify the use of the cryptography.</li></ul><p>Then what makes a good name? How do we know a name doesn&rsquo;t exist? Here are some heuristics:</p><ul><li>You&rsquo;re repeatedly encountering something that requires lengthy explanation each time</li><li>A name would help you notice patterns or make distinctions that matter</li><li>It enables better coordination between people working on something together</li><li>The act of naming itself forces useful clarity about what you&rsquo;re actually dealing with</li></ul><p>I think the name &ldquo;derivative&rdquo; fits them:</p><ul><li>I realized the absence of the name costs me lengthy explanation each time.</li><li>The name &ldquo;derivative&rdquo; is straightforward regarding the usage patterns: data derived from other data.</li><li>It enables better coordination with non-cryptographers and application designers.</li><li>By focusing on derivatives and claims, we can focus on users&rsquo; experience and problems, not just abstract cryptographic terms.</li></ul><p>The name &ldquo;derivative&rdquo; took inspiration from two fields:</p><ul><li>In <strong>finance</strong>, derivative assets, like futures and options, are derived from underlying assets, like stocks or commodities.</li><li>In <strong>copyright and art</strong>, people derive new works from their predecessors.</li></ul><h2 id=alternatives>Alternatives</h2><p>Here we&rsquo;ll argue the limitations of potential alternatives.</p><ul><li>Verifiable Credentials <sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>: Used in standardization work. Very specific to ID. It excludes email derivative use cases.</li><li>Anonymous Credentials <sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>: Used in academic work. Very specific to ID and privacy applications.</li><li>ZK ID / ZK wrapped ID <sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>: Used in blogging space and blockchain space. Emphasizes ID and cryptography tooling.</li><li>Universal Protocol / Universal Cryptographic Adapters / PODs <sup id=fnref1:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup>: 0xPARC pictured the most generalized use case and is closest to the meaning assigned to derivative. A POD is a derivative and can later be a derivable. Universal Cryptographic Adapters extract raw derivables into PODs. Finally, the Universal Protocol enables interactions between PODs. I think the distinction between derivative and 0xPARC terms is that the latter are for the infrastructure to enable the former. Universal Protocol, Universal Cryptographic Adapters, and PODs, each term alone seems unable to capture the whole class of applications.</li></ul><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>This is an example borrowed from <a href=https://0xparc.org/blog/programmable-cryptography-1>https://0xparc.org/blog/programmable-cryptography-1</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref1:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p><a href=https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#dfn-verifiable-credential>https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#dfn-verifiable-credential</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:3><p>example usage <a href=https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/2010>https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/2010</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:3 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:4><p><a href=https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/06/28/zkid.html>https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/06/28/zkid.html</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:4 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:5><p><a href=https://pod.org/>https://pod.org/</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:5 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></div></article><footer class="footer scrollappear"><p><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://liangcc.me/>CC's blog</a></span>
