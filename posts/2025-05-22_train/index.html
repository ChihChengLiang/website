Japanese / zh-TW
I&rsquo;ve been wanting to read a book about trains. Why? Because while trains use essentially the same technology worldwide, the user experience varies dramatically from country to country. That difference isn’t technical—it’s cultural. The book 定刻発車―日本の鉄道はなぜ世界で最も正確なのか？ (&ldquo;Depart on Time: Why Japanese Railways Are the World&rsquo;s Most Punctual&rdquo;) explores the historical and cultural factors behind Japan’s railway system.
Here are some of my favorite takeaways:
The Origins of Punctuality
One of the book’s most surprising insights is that Japan’s famed train punctuality didn’t start with trains. It goes all the way back to the Edo period, 400 years ago, when people coordinated daily life without clocks. Monks rang temple bells on time, guards followed strict shift rotations, and travelers gathered at prearranged hours. Punctuality was already a deeply embedded cultural norm—long before timetables existed."><meta name=author content><link rel=icon type=image/x-icon href=https://liangcc.me/images/favicon-dark.ico><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://liangcc.me/images/apple-touch-icon-dark.png><link rel=stylesheet type=text/css title=light id=light href=https://liangcc.me/stylesheets/light.css><link rel=stylesheet type=text/css title=dark id=dark href=https://liangcc.me/stylesheets/dark.css disabled><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://liangcc.me/custom.min.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://liangcc.me/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://liangcc.me/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.134.2"><meta property="og:url" content="https://liangcc.me/posts/2025-05-22_train/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="CC's blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Review: Why Japanese trains are so punctual?"><meta property="og:description" content="

Why? Because while trains use essentially the same technology worldwide, the <strong>user experience</strong> varies dramatically from country to country. That difference isn’t technical—it’s cultural. The book <em>定刻発車―日本の鉄道はなぜ世界で最も正確なのか？</em> (<em>&ldquo;Depart on Time: Why Japanese Railways Are the World&rsquo;s Most Punctual&rdquo;</em>) explores the historical and cultural factors behind Japan’s railway system.</p><p>Here are some of my favorite takeaways:</p><h3 id=the-origins-of-punctuality>The Origins of Punctuality</h3><p>One of the book’s most surprising insights is that Japan’s famed train punctuality didn’t start with trains. It goes all the way back to the <strong>Edo period</strong>, 400 years ago, when people coordinated daily life without clocks. Monks rang temple bells on time, guards followed strict shift rotations, and travelers gathered at prearranged hours. Punctuality was already a deeply embedded cultural norm—long before timetables existed.</p><p>When Tokyo began its rapid urban expansion, the train system couldn’t just add more tracks—land was too scarce. So it scaled through <strong>coordination</strong>: reducing departure intervals, speeding up boarding and alighting, and optimizing schedules to a near-surgical level. It’s a story not of building bigger systems, but of making tighter ones.</p><h3 id=the-trade-off-efficiency-vs-resilience>The Trade-off: Efficiency vs. Resilience</h3><p>The <strong>efficiency</strong> of Japan’s train system is often praised, but it comes at a cost: <strong>resilience</strong>. With fewer buffer tracks and tighter schedules, even a minor delay can snowball into major congestion. The system excels under normal conditions, but it&rsquo;s less forgiving when disruptions occur.</p><p>A striking example is a day at <strong>Shinjuku Station</strong>, one of the world’s busiest. It’s a marvel of scalability—but also a case study in fragility. A <strong>10-minute delay</strong> can overwhelm the platforms with people. The system is high-throughput, low-buffer—extremely efficient, but tightly wound.</p><h3 id=rails-and-economics>Rails and Economics</h3><p>The author approaches railways not as a train enthusiast, but as an <strong>economist</strong>. What fascinates them is how trains, like markets, are systems for managing <strong>expectations</strong>.</p><p>Both railways and economies are <strong>open systems</strong> with countless users. Small, local changes can lead to global instability. Both require stabilizers—prices in markets, operation plans in railways. And both are shaped by how people <strong>predict and respond</strong> to change.</p><h3 id=the-invisibility-of-modern-systems>The Invisibility of Modern Systems</h3><p>The preface presents a powerful idea: modern life is run by systems we can’t see. You can’t photograph an email being sent. We live inside black boxes—acting within systems whose inner workings remain opaque.</p><p>One haunting theme is this <strong>loss of visibility</strong> in everyday life. A generation ago, children could understand the world simply by walking through their village—seeing the baker, the carpenter, the policeman. Today, buildings arrive prefabricated. Infrastructure and services operate behind layers of abstraction.</p><p>The book argues that even the train—once a visible and tangible machine—is now part of this complexity. As the systems around us grow more opaque, people begin to lose sight of their own contribution to the world—and with it, their <strong>sense of purpose</strong>.</p><h3 id=the-train-drivers-zen>The Train Driver’s Zen</h3><p>Train drivers don’t sleep when they want; they sleep when the <strong>timetable</strong> allows. And their only moment of calm? When they’re actually <strong>driving</strong>—in sync with the machine, supported by a trustworthy system and fellow workers. There’s something poetic in that harmony between human and system.</p><h3 id=trains-are-predictive-systems>Trains Are Predictive Systems</h3><p>Timetables aren’t static—they’re constantly updated based on predictive data. Train planners adjust operations by monitoring ticket bookings, gate traffic, new residential and commercial developments, festivals, and even events like the <strong>Olympics</strong>. The system listens to the city.</p><h3 id=the-human-future-of-rail>The Human Future of Rail</h3><p>In the past, <strong>passengers had to adapt</strong> to the train. Now, technology helps trains adapt to the passenger. With smartphones and real-time updates, people find their own way around delays. In the future, passengers won’t be treated as a “flow,” but as <strong>individuals</strong>.</p><p>That also means making the workplace more inclusive—welcoming not just career men, but <strong>women, seniors, and foreign workers</strong>. The next-generation rail system must be not only efficient, but <strong>humane</strong>.</p><h3 id=my-quick-summary>My Quick Summary</h3><p>This book tells a rich story of <strong>historical path dependence</strong> and <strong>cultural coordination</strong>. Interestingly, <strong>market structures</strong> (like monopolies or competition) and <strong>legal factors</strong> barely feature. This suggests a kind of <strong>structural inertia</strong>—a lack of short-term agency. You can&rsquo;t just send a Japanese rail crew abroad to “fix” another country’s system. Changing the <strong>culture</strong> is slow, difficult work.</p><p>Let’s see how the <a href=https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5146508/amtrak-japan-texas-bullet-train-plan>Japanese bullet train project in Texas</a> goes. Will the system bend around local culture—or the other way around?</p><hr><p>Edited with ChatGPT 4o</p></div></article><footer class="footer scrollappear"><p><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://liangcc.me/>CC's blog</a></span>
