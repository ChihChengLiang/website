December 31, 2024 marks my last day in [Privacy and Scaling Explorations](https://pse.dev), a team supported by the Ethereum Foundation.

I joined Ethereum Foundation around the end of 2017. This former local community co-organizer was lucky to be trusted by the smartest and most inspiring people in the ecosystem. In the course of almost 7 years, I had the chance to contribute to early prototypes of Ethereum Proof of Stake, and later zero knowledge proofs and many exciting cryptography applications.

The decision of departure is personal. As 2025, the ecosystem is entering an exciting golden era of cryptography and PSE is in good hands. Over the years, I’ve reflected on the technologies we’ve been building, and I’ve realized how little I truly understand the world we aim to change. That realization has motivated me to dive deeper into reality and pursue independent research in economics.
