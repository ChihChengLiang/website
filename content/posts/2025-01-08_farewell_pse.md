December 31, 2024 marks my last day in [Privacy and Scaling Explorations](https://pse.dev), a team supported by the Ethereum Foundation.

My journey with the Ethereum Foundation began in late 2017. As a former local community co-organizer, I was fortunate to be trusted by the smartest and most inspiring people in the ecosystem. Throughout these seven years, I had the chance to contribute to early prototypes of Ethereum Proof of Stake, and later zero knowledge proofs and many exciting cryptography applications.

As we enter 2025, the ecosystem is entering an exciting golden era of cryptography and PSE is in good hands. Over the years, I've reflected on the technologies we've been building, and I've realized how little I truly understand the world we aim to change. That realization has motivated me to dive deeper into reality and pursue independent research in economics.

Monetary theory and modern macroeconomics would be my first step. Progresses and updates will be posted on this blog. Stay tuned and keep in touch.
