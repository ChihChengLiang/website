I've been wanting to read a book about trains. Why? Trains are basically the same technology worldwide, but their user experience vary across countries. The book "定刻発車―日本の鉄道はなぜ世界で最も正確なのか? (Depart on time, why japanese have the world's most punctual railways?)" explores the historical and cultural factors of Japanese rail system.

Here lists some of my notes:

### The Origin of the Punctuality 

One of the book’s most surprising insights is that Japan’s famous train punctuality didn’t begin with trains at all. It traces back to the Edo period (400 years ago), when people coordinated daily life without clocks -- monks ring the bell towers on time, guards follow tight shift schedules, and travelers group on specific time. Punctuality was a deeply embedded cultural value before timetables even existed.

Tokyo's rapid urban growth motivates the train system to scale. Limited by the scarce land to expand exiting rail roads, people boost the throughput with shorter intervals between departures, faster boarding and alighting, and extremely fine-tuned scheduling. It's a story not of bigger systems, but of tighter coordination.


### The trade off

**Efficiency** of Japanese train system is often celebrated, but the success comes with the cost of **resilience** -- less buffering tracks and time. 


### Rails and Economics

The author came from an economist background rather than a train lover background. Train interests the author because it's a system that manages expectations, just like economics system.

The author draws a surprising comparison: both railways and economies are open systems with uncountable users. Local disturbances can cause global instability. You need stabilizers—whether that’s price (in markets) or updated operation plans (in trains). Both rely on expectations. Both are lived realities *and* abstractions.


### The Invisibility of Modern Systems

The preface opens with a sobering idea: modern life is ruled by complex systems that we can’t see. You can’t "photograph" how email works. We live in black boxes—where we act, but often can’t *see* the mechanism.

### The Busy Shinjuku Station

The book zooms into a day at Shinjuku Station—one of the busiest in the world. It’s a marvel of scalability. But with that comes fragility. A 10-minute delay can ripple out, clogging the station with people, making the whole system seize up. It has high throughput but low buffer.

### The Train Driver’s Zen

Train drivers don’t sleep when they want—they sleep when the train schedule says so. Their only moment of calm? When they're actually *driving*. That’s when they’re in sync with the system, backed by its reliability and the trustworthiness of every fellow worker.

### Train Systems are Predictive

Time tables are not written and then set in stones. Train planners anticipates potential demand bursts and adjust the operation plan accordingly. Ticket bookings, gate scans, residential construction, festivals, and even the Olympics feed into the system.

### The lost of the sense of reality in life

One haunting theme: the loss of visibility. Kids once learned about society by walking the village—seeing the baker, the carpenter, the policeman. Now? Buildings arrive as prefabs. Services run invisibly.


### The Human Future of Rail

In the past, passengers bent around the train. Now, technology bends around the passenger. With mobile phones and maps, users adapt in real-time. Passengers would be no longer treated as a "flow," but a real human.

Systems must become less rigid—more humane. That means better conditions for frontline workers, attracting not just career men, but women, elders, and foreigners.

### My quick summary 

Overall, this book tells a story of history path-dependence and cultural factors. It seemed market factors -- monopoly or oligopoly, and legal factors play very little role in the story. This suggests a lack of agency -- it's hard to come up with an actionable plan to improve a situation, like sending a Japanese rail crew to fix a foreign rail system. Changing the culture is the slow and painful way to work.
