Opinions are mine.

## Motivation

Having worked in Ethereum ecosystem for 5 years, I've learned Proof of Work, Proof of Stack, and all the zeroknowledge crazy stuff.

Ethereum, as a crypto-currency, is a highly relavent monetary topic. "ETH is money," said some zealous folks. I found myself doesn't understand money much.

As a Finance major in university 10 years, I did take a Money and Banking course before. That's all I know. The takeaway from me is that 

1. Money is a macro-economics subject. We are not talking about money without the context of price level etc.
2. Money seems has little to do with finance. There was comercial banks involved to pull all that wierd multiplier effect off. But we don't actually see money in asset pricing or financial institute management courses.

Back to the crypto scene, there are some desired usecases for crypto.

- Buying coffee with crypto. This seeming naive use case requires some good properties: cheap transaction fee, good privacy, and stable coin value. Not to mention good key management and wallet experience.
- Supporting people who lives in a government/monetary dysfunctioning areas.


### It is hard to talk about money. Noise to signal is big.



## Lots of outdated, overcomplicated, overlooked theory

- outdated: quantity theory of money
- overcomplicated: the search theory of money
- overlooked: the fiscal theory of money
  - designed for cashless society
  - binds monetary theory with fiscal.

## Barriers and challenges
### The traditional monetary literature focus on central banking
### Macro finance involves difficult math


### The existing problem of stable coins

No marcro variable. Pegging is out-sourcing the duty to central banks and sweap the problem away.

Uniswap shows some light on doing a decentralized price oracle.

## Opportunities in Crypto

Most money theorists are dismissive with crypto. I'd say the reason is most of the professionals stopped at Bitcoin level and are unaware of the capabilities of general computing blockchain can do.

- Redesign a functioning system
- Commitments: A functioning governance system commits to policies. I think this is what crypto space really good at. I think the ice-age mechnism is an great example and is underhyped
- A coordinated monetary and fiscal policy
- We have fee burns. post 1559 world. Tx revenue + Signoreage. Visible protocol revenue.
  - It established taxing and fiscal foundations for crypto.
  - ETH hasn't put on that ring of power yet, but Zcash has been experimenting it.
  - We spent the fiscal funding only on security budget. More can be done

## Actions

- Crypto people talk to some Macro finance acedemics.
- Test some proposals on rollups.
