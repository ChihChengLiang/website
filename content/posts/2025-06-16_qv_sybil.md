## Quick Quadratic Voting Recap

Quadratic Voting is a voting mechanism that allows voters to express different level of support by spending "voice credits" (VC) at an increasing cost. The key feature is that casting $X$ votes costs $X^2$ voice credits. For example, 1 vote costs 1 VC, 2 votes costs 4, and 3 votes costs 9.

This quadratic cost structure creates a crucial trade-off: voters can express strong preferences on issues they care deeply about, but at a rapidly increasing price.

## The Identity Problem

Quadratic Voting relies on a robust identity system to work. Without it, the mechanism breaks down because the quadratic cost structure can be circumvented through identity manipulation.

Consider the difference between these scenarios:

- **Single identity**: Casting 2 votes costs 4 VC
- **Two identities**: Casting 2 votes (1 from each identity) costs only 2 VC total

This disparity creates a powerful incentive to control multiple identities, undermining the system's integrity.

## Optimal Vote Allocation Strategy

To understand the advantage of controlling multiple identities, let's examine how to cast 4 votes using 2 identities (A and B) efficiently:

- **Single identity approach**: 4 votes cost 16 VC
- **Uneven split (3+1)**: 9 + 1 = 10 VC total
- **Even split (2+2)**: 4 + 4 = 8 VC total

The even split is optimal, and this pattern holds generally due to the marginal cost structure.

### Understand Marginal Costs

The marginal cost of each additional vote increases linearly:

| Vote Number| Total VC Cost| Marginal Cost |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 4 | 3 |
| 3 | 9 | 5 |
| 4 | 16 | 7 |

When allocating votes across multiple identities, the optimal strategy follows a simple principle: always assign the next vote to the identity with the lowest current marginal cost. This naturally leads to an even distribution.

### The General Formula

For $X$ total votes distributed across $N$ identities:

- Each identity casts $X/N$ votes
- Each identity spends $(X/N)^2$ voice credits
- Total cost: $X^2/N$ voice credits

This represents a cost reduction factor of $N$ compared to using a single identity.


Faking an identity might take some effort. With $N$ heads in your control, how much advantage can you get in the quadratic voting?

For a simple case, consider you have a goal to cast 4 votes with 2 identities, A and B, what would be the cheapest way to complete it?

- First we know it takes 16 VC for 1 person to do so. A contributes 4 vote would be the same case, no advantage gained from extra identities.
- 3 votes from A and 1 from B, would cost 10 VC in total.
- 2 votes each would cost 8 VC in total.

It's temping to say spliting the vote evenly minimizes the costs.

That's indeed the case by observing the marginal cost of extra vote:

| vote| VC cost| extra cost |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 4 | 3 |
| 3 | 9 | 5 |
| 4 | 16 | 7 |

Notice that the marginal cost grows linearly.

Let's allocate the 4 votes one by one, first one to A.

| total vote| A vote| A VC | B vote| B VC| total VC | comment|
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | |
| 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | Allocating the second vote on A would cost additional 3 VC, while on B cost 1 |
| 3 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 5 | |
| 4 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 8 | Allocating the 4th vote on A would cost additional 5 VC, while on B cost 3|

Following the same reasoning, you would let N identities share equal votes. Otherwise, the one would votes more would incur higher marginal cost than the one who votes less. Take one vote from the higher to the lower would improve the situation, till you can't.

In general, to cast $X$ votes with $N$ identities, each contribute $\frac{X}{N}$ votes and costs $\frac{X}{N}^2$ VC, costing total $\frac{X^2}{N}$.

In other words, a budget of $Y$ VC, solving $Y = X^2$ or $Y = \frac{X^2}{N}$, allows an individual to cast $\sqrt{Y}$ votes or a $N$ colluding coalition to cast $\sqrt{NY}$ votes.

Let's compare quadratic voting (qv) with one person one vote (1p1v) and one dollar one vote (1$1v). Here assume 1 VC worth 1 dollar for comparison.

|Method| Marginal cost | strength of influence (with one identity and budget Y)| strength of influence (with N identity and budget Y) |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1p1v | $\infty$ | 1 | $N$ |
| qv | $2X - 1$ (at $X$ vote) | $\sqrt{Y}$ | $\sqrt{N}\sqrt{Y}$ |
| 1$1v | $1$ | $Y$| $Y$ |

In summary, with N people in your control, you can ask them to cast N votes in 1p1v. The advantage is smaller in qv by multiplying your inflences $\sqrt{N}$. No effect for 1$1v, which is sybil safe, it doesn't care a dollar comes from who.
