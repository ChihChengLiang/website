Quadratic Voting is a voting method where voters can express different level of support, by spending a costly "voice credit" (VC) they endowged with. For example, to support a proposal with 1 vote costs 1 VC, 2 votes costs 4, and 3 votes costs 9, and so on. In general, $X$ votes costs $X^2$, hence the name quadratic.

This voting method requires an identity system to work. As one person, it takes 4 VC to cast 2 votes; But for two people, it takes total 2 VC, each person contributes 1 vote. The latter is cheaper. The quadratic cost breaks if the voting system can't count people's heads.

Faking an identity might take some effort. With $N$ heads in your control, how much advantage can you get in the quadratic voting?

For a simple case, consider you have a goal to cast 4 votes with 2 identities, A and B, what would be the cheapest way to complete it?

- First we know it takes 16 VC for 1 person to do so. A contributes 4 vote would be the same case, no advantage gained from extra identities.
- 3 votes from A and 1 from B, would cost 10 VC in total.
- 2 votes each would cost 8 VC in total.

It's temping to say spliting the vote evenly minimizes the costs.

That's indeed the case by observing the marginal cost of extra vote:

| vote| VC cost| extra cost |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 4 | 3 |
| 3 | 9 | 5 |
| 4 | 16 | 7 |

Notice that the marginal cost grows linearly.

Let's allocate the 4 votes one by one, first one to A.

| total vote| A vote| A VC | B vote| B VC| total VC | comment|
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | |
| 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | Allocating the second vote on A would cost additional 3 VC, while on B cost 1 |
| 3 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 5 | |
| 4 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 8 | Allocating the 4th vote on A would cost additional 5 VC, while on B cost 3|

Following the same reasoning, you would let N identities share equal votes. Otherwise, the one would votes more would incur higher marginal cost than the one who votes less. Take one vote from the higher to the lower would improve the situation, till you can't.

In general, to cast $X$ votes with $N$ identities, each contribute $\frac{X}{N}$ votes and costs $\frac{X}{N}^2$ VC, costing total $\frac{X^2}{N}$.

In other words, a budget of $Y$ VC, solving $Y = X^2$ or $Y = \frac{X^2}{N}$, allows an individual to cast $\sqrt{Y}$ votes or a $N$ colluding coalition to cast $\sqrt{NY}$ votes.

Let's compare quadratic voting (qv) with one person one vote (1p1v) and one dollar one vote (1$1v). Here assume 1 VC worth 1 dollar for comparison.

|Method| Marginal cost | strength of influence (with one identity and budget Y)| strength of influence (with N identity and budget Y) |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1p1v | $\infty$ | 1 | $N$ |
| qv | $2X - 1$ (at $X$ vote) | $\sqrt{Y}$ | $\sqrt{N}\sqrt{Y}$ |
| 1$1v | $1$ | $Y$| $Y$ |

In summary, with N people in your control, you can ask them to cast N votes in 1p1v. The advantage is smaller in qv by multiplying your inflences $\sqrt{N}$. No effect for 1$1v, which is sybil safe, it doesn't care a dollar comes from who.
