### The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet

I remember there was a Korean CEO got interviewed by a crypto media about his take on a new US regulation. The CEO replied that he is not an American. The crypto Twitter laughed about the interview. The question is considered ridiculus because why would a Korean team building decentralized software cares about US regulation?

This book changed my mind. To some extend, the US regulation seemed to have shaped the Internet world today.

The book focuses on only one tiny section. The Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act. The law was enacted during 1990s, when the whole internet has only 3 providers, CompuServe, Prodigy, and America Online.

Section 230 basically says "The platform is not liable to the contents posted on it." It gives powerful protections to the Internet platforms today. To see this arguement, the author gave a great example. Twitter processed 6000 tweets per second, while Facebook handled 3 millions posts per minutes. How many tweets or posts can make the company legally liable? Without the over-powered protection from section 230, there's no way the companies can thrive today. On the contrary, Delfi is the largest website in Estonia. It already featured strict content control. But still in 2006, some offensive comments were posted on the platform. Despite being deleted immediately, Delfi got sued and fined. The court considered Delfi didn't protect the users enough. The same case in US would have never entered the court, because of section 230.

The book traces the history of section 230. It started as an overlooked section. Then a daring lawyer used it in a case. It became so powerful that all the Internet platforms rely on it. So powerful that the people and terroists abused it. The cases start with pranks, deframation, all the way to greater harm of reputation, safety, and life. The courts ruled in favor of the platforms, even in the case that the people who sued are very powerful people in whitehose.

The author argues that it's hard to compare the goods and bads of the protections of Section 230. All the harms in those cases are relatable. But the protection also gives us great public good like Wikipedia. After reviewed the most extreme case of harm in the book, the author thinks the protection of Section 230 is still required, only small modification is needed.
