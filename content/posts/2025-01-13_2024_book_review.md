### The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet

I remember there was a Korean CEO got interviewed by a crypto media about his take on a new US regulation. The CEO replied that he is not an American. The crypto Twitter laughed about the interview. The question is considered ridiculus because why would a Korean team building decentralized software cares about US regulation?

This book changed my mind. To some extend, the US regulation seemed to have shaped the Internet world today.

The book focuses on only one tiny section. The Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act. The law was enacted during 1990s, when the whole internet has only 3 providers, CompuServe, Prodigy, and America Online.

Section 230 basically says "The platform is not liable to the contents posted on it." It gives powerful protections to the Internet platforms today. To see this arguement, the author gave a great example. Twitter processed 6000 tweets per second, while Facebook handled 3 millions posts per minutes. How many tweets or posts can make the company legally liable? Without the over-powered protection from section 230, there's no way the companies can thrive today. On the contrary, Delfi is the largest website in Estonia. It already featured strict content control. But still in 2006, some offensive comments were posted on the platform. Despite being deleted immediately, Delfi got sued and fined. The court considered Delfi didn't protect the users enough. The same case in US would have never entered the court, because of section 230.

The book traces the history of section 230. It started as an overlooked section. Then a daring lawyer used it in a case. It became so powerful that all the Internet platforms rely on it. So powerful that the people and terroists abused it. The cases start with pranks, deframation, all the way to greater harm of reputation, safety, and life. The courts ruled in favor of the platforms, even in the case that the people who sued are very powerful people in whitehose.

The author argues that it's hard to compare the goods and bads of the protections of Section 230. All the harms in those cases are relatable. But the protection also gives us great public good like Wikipedia. After reviewed the most extreme case of harm in the book, the author thinks the protection of Section 230 is still required, only small modification is needed.

I've been thinking what lessons should we draw from the story of Section 230 and apply to the decentralized system we've been building in the past?

Maybe the first lesson for me is to recognize that the US legal landscape still matters. After all, we wouldn't be using modern cryptography today if we lost [Crypto Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars).

The book also motivates me to think about the harms our system we've caused in the past and potentially in the future. The blockchain and cryptography are very powerful. And we have seen no lack of bad actors abusing the tooling for harms. The system has externalities and an alignment problem to solve.

### Good Economics for Hard Times

This  content dense 300 pages book covers all the important topics like immigrations, world trades, economic growth, global warming, automation, and universal basic income (UBI). It was finished in Q1 2019, before getting spoilered by COVID and ChatGPT.

Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo have become my favorite economists. I like them from their previous book "Poor Economics" already.

One quick highlight is for the "transparency" of a government. We open source people likes transparency a lot. With the scrutiny from the public, transparency helps fight corruption in many cases. But it does not come for free. Transparency makes government officials check all the boxes to avoid the trouble. Sometimes it creates bureacracies and inefficiencies.

The book illutstrates the point with the Italian government organization Consip. Consip helps government purchase items. It was setup after the government faced a series of corruptions and scandles. After Consip is setup, the government can purchase items themself, or via Consip. But when the Consip option is avaliable, the government officials always choose the Consip option, even if the item is cheaper to buy by themself.

Overall, from the book I can feel the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is a powerful tool to evaluate effects of policies. This is something I'd like to explore further.

Secondly, this book also make me wonder about the priority. What are the issues people or the world leaderships care? Comparing to the [d/acc](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/01/05/dacc2.html) topics like nuclear risks, AI risks, or bio risks. The former sounds more like the world of "average" and the latter is the existential risks (X-risk), the world of "rare" events.

There's a saying the [world is getting weirder than before](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-08-01/the-future-will-be-weirder-than-we-think), and the past experience offers less valuable guidance for us in the future. Does that implies we should channel our effort more on the X-risk rather than the average cases? Or X-risk doesn't matter that much because if we survive through it, we still need to face the average world like the post cold war era?
