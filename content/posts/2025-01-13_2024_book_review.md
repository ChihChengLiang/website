### The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet

I remember there was a Korean CEO got interviewed by a crypto media about his take on a new US regulation. The CEO replied that he is not an American. The crypto Twitter laughed about the interview. The question is considered ridiculus because why would a Korean team building decentralized software cares about US regulation?

This book changed my mind. To some extend, the US regulation seemed to have shaped the Internet world today.

The book focuses on only one tiny section. The Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act. The law was enacted during 1990s, when the whole internet has only 3 providers, CompuServe, Prodigy, and America Online.

Section 230 basically says "The platform is not liable to the contents posted on it." It gives powerful protections to the Internet platforms today. To see this arguement, the author gave a great example. Twitter processed 6000 tweets per second, while Facebook handled 3 millions posts per minutes. How many tweets or posts can make the company legally liable? Without the over-powered protection from section 230, there's no way the companies can thrive today. On the contrary, Delfi is the largest website in Estonia. It already featured strict content control. But still in 2006, some offensive comments were posted on the platform. Despite being deleted immediately, Delfi got sued and fined. The court considered Delfi didn't protect the users enough. The same case in US would have never entered the court, because of section 230.

The book traces the history of section 230. It started as an overlooked section. Then a daring lawyer used it in a case. It became so powerful that all the Internet platforms rely on it. So powerful that the people and terroists abused it. The cases start with pranks, deframation, all the way to greater harm of reputation, safety, and life. The courts ruled in favor of the platforms, even in the case that the people who sued are very powerful people in whitehose.

The author argues that it's hard to compare the goods and bads of the protections of Section 230. All the harms in those cases are relatable. But the protection also gives us great public good like Wikipedia. After reviewed the most extreme case of harm in the book, the author thinks the protection of Section 230 is still required, only small modification is needed. The author is optimistic on the platform owners to self-correct, which is a little bit naive I think. Daron Acemoglu proposed a full removal of Section 230 in power and progress, btw.  

I've been thinking what lessons should we draw from the story of Section 230 and apply to the decentralized system we've been building in the past?

Maybe the first lesson for me is to recognize that the US legal landscape still matters. After all, we wouldn't be using modern cryptography today if we lost [Crypto Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars).

The book also motivates me to think about the harms our system we've caused in the past and potentially in the future. The blockchain and cryptography are very powerful. And we have seen no lack of bad actors abusing the tooling for harms. The system has externalities and an alignment problem to solve.

### Good Economics for Hard Times

This  content dense 300 pages book covers all the important topics like immigrations, world trades, economic growth, global warming, automation, and universal basic income (UBI). It was finished in Q1 2019, before getting spoilered by COVID and ChatGPT.

Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo have become my favorite economists. I like them from their previous book "Poor Economics" already.

One quick highlight is for the "transparency" of a government. We open source people likes transparency a lot. With the scrutiny from the public, transparency helps fight corruption in many cases. But it does not come for free. Transparency makes government officials check all the boxes to avoid the trouble. Sometimes it creates bureacracies and inefficiencies.

The book illutstrates the point with the Italian government organization Consip. Consip helps government purchase items. It was setup after the government faced a series of corruptions and scandles. After Consip is setup, the government can purchase items themself, or via Consip. But when the Consip option is avaliable, the government officials always choose the Consip option, even if the item is cheaper to buy by themself.

Overall, from the book I can feel the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is a powerful tool to evaluate effects of policies. This is something I'd like to explore further.

Secondly, this book also make me wonder about the priority. What are the issues people or the world leaderships care? Comparing to the [d/acc](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/01/05/dacc2.html) topics like nuclear risks, AI risks, or bio risks. The former sounds more like the world of "average" and the latter is the existential risks (X-risk), the world of "rare" events.

There's a saying the [world is getting weirder than before](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-08-01/the-future-will-be-weirder-than-we-think), and the past experience offers less valuable guidance for us in the future. Does that implies we should channel our effort more on the X-risk rather than the average cases? Or X-risk doesn't matter that much because if we survive through it, we still need to face the average world like the post cold war era?


### Growth: A History and a Reckoning

I have a separate [post](/posts/2024-09-13_growth/) on this book, but unfortunately its in Chinese.

I like this book approach this topic in a mixture of economists and futurists.

The book argues aginst degrowthers and longtermists for lack of imagaination.

There's no such thing as "the limited resources can't support unlimited growth." There are infinite ways we can combine resources for better use. So idea and research matters.

I see the parallism that Growth is the north star thinking and GDP is that metric that people obseesed with.

Growth is not just about forward or backward, it's about the direction. And if we can decide the direction, there's a moral problem of the tradeoff of growth.

Moral problem aside, how can we get more growth?

The book argue to increase the production of ideas. The patent system is too old that needs a reform. More R&D investment. More people become inventors. More efficiency in research. The last one is important. Collages have too many administrative staffs. 50% in harvard. 40% of researcher's time is applying grants.

To improve the research efficinecy, AI must be used. protein folding is a problem that one folding would use the whole career of a phD. But deepmind just completed millions in one go.

The more instereting part is what are not efficient ways for growth?

- Physical infra, bridges and roads. Big infra structures are super wasteful (As we'll see in the "How Big Things Get Done" for this topic). This also falls into the trap of capital dominated thinking. The diminishing marginal utility of capital will kick in.
- better utliization of land and better cities. Paul Romer is a big fan of cities. He thinks clustering talents in a big city can improve idea exchange, and thus boost econ growth. The author is skeptical about this idea. First, there's no empirical evidence for that. Second, as the remote working is popularized, does meeting people IRL matters that much? Having working in Ethereum for a long time, most of the time we work remote. Sometimes we travel to Devcon or Devconnect to meet people in real life. I'd say there's a healthy dose of meeting people IRL. The recently popularized half or one month long "residencies" seems to be a good balance. I also see a similarity in Popup cities and Paul Romer's chartered cities idea, which "Good Economics for Hard Times" described how it failed spectacularly. 
- More educations. This is the most interesting point to me. Less and less counteries can put more than 90% of people to finish junior high school and more than 50% of people to collage. The "century of human capital" is not happening again. Before reading this book, I believed in the potential of education. But maybe we can 2x, 3x, or even 10x our human capabilty, but can we compete with the 100x productivity like the protien folding AI do?

### How Big Things Get Done: The Surprising Factors That Determine the Fate of Every Project, from Home Renovations to Space Exploration and Everything In Between

Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner specialize in studying large-scale, high-cost projects, such as bridges, subways, and nuclear power plants. Delays and budget overruns are commonplace for these projects. But why do these happen, and is there a systematic way to avoid them? These are the questions the authors seek to answer.

Here are some key points that I still remember:

People often only notice that a project has become a disaster once it’s already underway. However, problems usually start as early as the “why initiate this project?” phase, followed by issues during the planning stage, and finally during execution.

The most critical part is to ensure there’s a satisfactory answer to why the project is being initiated. The authors’ favorite example is the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. Initially, the local government wanted to renovate an old building into a Guggenheim Museum. Architect Frank Gehry asked why the government wanted to do this. The answer was that they hoped to revitalize local tourism in response to urban decline. After surveying the site, Gehry found that renovating the old building wouldn’t achieve the desired effect, but building a new structure by the riverside would. This led to the creation of the now-famous museum.

Why are projects often initiated for the wrong reasons? The authors, a close associate of Daniel Kahneman (of *Thinking, Fast and Slow* fame), have differing views on why projects fail. Kahneman attributes it mainly to behavioral biases, but the authors believe “strategic misrepresentation” in politics is the primary factor. Eventually, they agreed both factors contribute: For smaller projects led by individuals, behavioral biases (such as over-optimism about budgets and timelines or action bias) are key. For projects within complex social structures, like governments or large corporations, strategic misrepresentation (underestimating costs or timelines to gain approval) becomes the main culprit.

The authors summarize their philosophy on successful projects with the phrase *slow thinking, fast execution*. This means preparing thoroughly during the planning stage and acting decisively during execution. While this may sound obvious, it might also seem like a "waterfall" approach to those accustomed to Scrum.

Planning, according to the authors, isn’t about sitting at a desk staring at a blank sheet of paper or creating thick, overly detailed project proposals. Such approaches misunderstand the essence of planning.

The authors view planning as a dynamic process rather than a static one. In the case of the Bilbao museum, Gehry used 3D architectural simulation software to refine design details. Pixar’s high movie success rate comes from thoroughly identifying potential issues during the planning phase. Their directors spend up to two years brainstorming story ideas, create rough hand-drawn storyboards for feedback, and refine their work through multiple iterations before starting animation.

The Latin word *experiri* is the root of both "experiment" and "experience," and the authors consider these two to be invaluable to projects. Using simulations or iterative processes, as with Gehry and Pixar, allows exploration of possible scenarios and identification of potential problems before significant investments are made. This aligns with the lean startup’s iterative philosophy.

Regarding experience, the authors highlight three key points:

1. **Avoiding uniqueness bias:** Most people think their project is unprecedented. Projects branded as "newest, biggest, first" often start with grandiose but flawed motives, sometimes driven by political or personal ambitions. Leaders may refuse to halt bad projects due to sunk cost bias. Alternatively, project initiators might overlook similarities between their project and others. The result is often underestimating costs and timelines. The author advocates Daniel Kahneman’s lesser-known *reference class* method, which involves looking at similar projects to see how much they exceeded budgets and timelines. While this doesn’t eliminate risk, it provides insights into potential pitfalls. The authors have built a database of large-scale projects for future reference.

2. **Leveraging expert experience:** The author emphasizes hiring top talent from day one instead of waiting until problems arise to bring in "firefighting" experts. Using established models wherever possible can also prevent mistakes, just like avoiding new, untested software packages.

3. **Positive vs. negative learning:** Modularization is a standout concept. Solar and wind energy projects tend to have the least cost overruns and delays because they use modular components, allowing incremental progress and learning from each unit. In contrast, nuclear power plants, which require all components to work perfectly before operation, have severe cost overruns and delays. Negative learning, where every new issue exacerbates overruns and delays, so people hide problems and avoid learning. The authors believe the future of nuclear power lies in smaller, modular designs. Large-scale projects tend to drag out over time, increasing exposure to “black swans” like pandemics, tsunamis, or reactor meltdowns.
